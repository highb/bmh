Here is the revised blog post with more details for a tutorial-style walkthrough:

Here we go! As I sit down to write this tutorial, Iâ€™m filled with a mixture of excitement and anxiety. Excitement at the prospect of setting up my own little Kubernetes cluster to explore and build fun projects on, but also anxiety about the implications of developing and promoting tools that could someday replace my own job. As an amateur writer and coder, what will happen when AI systems get so advanced that they put me out of work? For now though, on to the fun stuff!

## Why Raspberry Pi?  

Raspberry Pis are cheap, low-power ARM computers perfect for learning and tinkering. Using Pis meant I could set up a cluster without breaking the bank or causing too much of a power draw. For this tutorial, I used the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

## Why k3s?   

k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution perfect for low-resource systems like the Raspberry Pi. Regular Kubernetes is a bit too heavy for the Pis, but k3s is optimized to run on systems with 1GB of RAM or less. 

## What I did

Following [Alex Ellis](https://www.alexellis.io/)' blog, I bought 3 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B kits to get started. I already had some network equipment from Ubiquiti to set up an isolated VLAN for the cluster.  

For the OS, I downloaded Ubuntu Core for the Pi 4 and flashed it to each SD card using Etcher. I chose Ubuntu Core since its Snap packages make it easy to keep up to date. I went with the 32-bit OS for the Pis.  

With the OS installed, I used Ansible to configure each Pi with a static IP address on my isolated network VLAN. I set the hostname for each Pi: bwolf1, bwolf2, and bwolf3.

On bwolf1, I installed k3s using k3sup, a Kubernetes cli installer:

```bash
k3sup install --ip 10.0.80.20 --user pi 
```

Then I joined the other Pis to make a 3-node control plane cluster:

```bash 
k3sup join --ip 10.0.80.21 --server-ip 10.0.80.20 --user pi
k3sup join --ip 10.0.80.22 --server-ip 10.0.80.20 --user pi
```

With the cluster set up, I tested it out by deploying an nginx deployment:

```bash 
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```  

The deployment worked! Now I have a fun platform to deploy apps, dashboards, and more. I'm excited to start tinkering with Kubernetes and seeing what I can build.

While the means of production for some types of creative work may change with the advancement of technology like Kubernetes and LLMs, the human urge to build, make, and express ourselves will endure. Though my job may change, I know that I will continue to write and code in some form. For now, on to the next project!
