How times have changed-- they always do. Just about one year ago, Samantha and I were celebrating the first anniversary of [Portlandish (pdx.sh)](https://pdx.sh), reflecting on the joy of building a small, vibrant community. We spoke of how fulfilling it was to offer a little corner of the internet free from ads, fostering conversations about science, art, activism, and, of course, cats.

Today, we announce that Portlandish will cease operations on March 6, 2025. This decision comes in response to the [shifting political landscape in the United States](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/czxrnw5qrprt), including potential changes to [Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230), which could make it increasingly difficult for small platforms like ours to operate safely and sustainably.

When we started Portlandish, it was a reaction to the turbulence of social media—particularly Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter—and a belief that smaller, more intentional communities could be a refuge. We’ve loved seeing this space grow, evolve, and spark meaningful conversations over the past two years. But the challenges of maintaining such a space have grown too significant for us to continue.

### Shutdown Timeline

- **December 6, 2024**: Official announcement of shutdown.
- **March 6, 2025**: Portlandish will cease operations, and all data will be permanently deleted.
- **March 6, 2025**: Our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pdxsh) will also be closed on this date.

### What Your Options Are

As Portlandish is shutting down, you have several options:

1. **Migrate to a New Server**
   Mastodon offers a migration feature that allows you to move your followers to a new server.
   - Go to **Preferences > Account > Account Settings**, or use this link: [https://pdx.sh/settings/migration](https://pdx.sh/settings/migration).
   - All followers will move to your new account.
   - Your current account’s profile will be updated with a redirect notice and excluded from searches.
   - No other data (such as posts or media) will be moved automatically.

2. **Export Your Data**
   Download a copy of your account data, including posts, followers, and media.
   - Go to **Preferences > Import and Export > Data Export**, or use this link: [https://pdx.sh/settings/export](https://pdx.sh/settings/export).

3. **Do Nothing**
   If you choose to take no action, your account and all associated data will be permanently deleted after March 6, 2025.

### Staying True to Our Covenant

Portlandish was founded on a promise to create a safe, inclusive space free from racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. While we are unable to continue providing this service, we encourage you to explore other Mastodon servers that uphold these values:

- Active moderation against harmful content.
- Reliable daily backups.
- Multiple administrators with infrastructure access for emergencies.
- A commitment to giving users adequate notice before shutting down.

We also recommend choosing a server hosted outside the United States or other [Five Eyes alliance countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes) for enhanced data privacy and security. The [Mastodon Server Picker](https://joinmastodon.org/servers) is a great resource to help you find your next online home.

### Closure of OpenCollective

As part of this shutdown, we will also be closing our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pdxsh) account on March 6, 2025. We deeply appreciate everyone who contributed to Portlandish’s sustainability through your generosity. Your support helped make this community possible, and we are profoundly grateful.

### A Heartfelt Thank You

Looking back on that post from a year ago, I’m struck by how much Portlandish has meant to Samantha and me—and, we hope, to all of you. Together, we’ve built a community that embraced the best of what the Fediverse has to offer: meaningful conversations, creative expression, and a sense of belonging.

When we wrote that first anniversary post, we believed that “you don’t have to change the whole world—just your small part of it.” That belief hasn’t changed, and we hope Portlandish has been a positive force in your life.

If you have any questions or need assistance during this transition, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to help.

Thank you for being part of Portlandish. It has been an honor and a joy to build this community with you.

With gratitude and respect,
Brandon & Samantha
