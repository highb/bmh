Well, [pdx.sh](https://pdx.sh) is [gone](https://blog.bmh.io/posts/2024-12-06-portlandish-shutting-down/). The VM, DB and massive object storage are all deleted. I'm feeling a mixture of sadness and relief. I want to say that I'm hopeful that not being responsible for running that server is going to free up my creative energy for some exciting new project that I am announcing today but I don't have anything to announce. I'm exhausted by both becoming a parent and by the general state of the world right now. What I need most is some time to rest and reflect while working my day job, then maybe some new ideas will come. If you want to do the social media thing, I can now be found as [@highb@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@highb).
