I'm really enjoying working with Rust so I've migrated this blog to Zola. After explaining why I'm switching, I'll provide a brief walkthough of the steps I had to take.\nWhy Zola?\nI was previously using Hexo for my blog, which is yet another static site generator in JS. It's quite popular, but I don't work very often with the NodeJS ecosystem so I found that every time I wanted to write a new blog post, I had to get aquainted with the latest updates to all the various dependencies -- many of which had security issues. That was all quite a bit of effort for software that is only ever used in the build process to generate static HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\nThis is all in stark contrast to Zola which is written in Rust and distributed as a single binary with no dependencies. Sure, if I wanted to build my own binary of Zola I would need to figure out and manage upgrading the dependencies. But as someone who just wants to write a comically simple blog documenting my learning, a single binary with an easily understandable version is just what I need. The site builds in a few milliseconds and has a local hot-reload command to preview my changes. The fact that it was trivial to migrate my existing posts written in Markdown over left me with no reason not to do it. How easy, you ask?\nGenerate a new Zola project\nI used the default Zola site init tool to make an example set of folders and config, then copied it over my old repo.\nzola init bmh\ncp -r bmh/* bmh-github/*\n\nCopy over the relevant config from the old project\nMigrating the configuration over from Hexo was mostly a matter of setting a title and enabling some of the features. My blog is pretty simple so YMMV.\nTest it out\nZola has a fast reload command for previewing changes during development. After a little while playing around with that, I had my site setup with a fork of an upstream Zola theme that looks good enough for me.\nzola serve\n\nSetup deployment\nI used Vercel to do the build and deploy with Hexo. They also support Zola so when I pushed up a new branch with Zola configured instead of Hexo, they automatically generated the site.\nOther goings on\nI'm starting out on the Zero to Production in Rust book. I'm on Chapter 3 and it has been a good read so far, although I'm debating if I want to make use of the GitHub actions that are available or if I want to setup some run steps to call the various cargo commands myself. For a real \"production\" experience, it does seem like it would be wise to roll my own instead but I think for the sake of learning it's fine.\n","id":"https://blog.bmh.io/converted-to-zola/","title":"Migrating to Zola"},"https://blog.bmh.io/how-terraform-implicit-dependencies-work/":{"body":"Have you ever wondered how Terraform Implicit Dependencies actually work in practice?\nIn today's blog, I'm going to craft a toy example that demonstrates how I understand that they work using local_file resources and thus not requiring any cloud connection or even internet connectivity.\nWhat do you mean by Implicit Dependencies?\nYou might be wondering, \"Implicit Dependencies... are those like the stuff artists do to avoid getting a Parental Advisory: Explicit Content sticker on their albums?\" Which, yeah, I guess it could be but I'm talking about Terraform here. In Terraform, every time that you run a terraform plan or terraform apply, the tool is internally building a directed acyclic graph that models the dependencies between resources in your configuration that you specify using HCL. The edges in this graph are the dependency relationships between your resources and they are typically inferred by Terraform without you explicitly specifying them. It is possible to specify these dependencies explicitly using the depends_on meta-argument but, as I will discuss in this post, that won't necessarily do what you might expect.\nIf you aren't required to specify anything about the resource dependencies explicitly, then how does Terraform know what the implicit dependencies are? Like any good private investigator, Terraform knows who you're talking to. It uses the references that you are already making every time that you reference the output values of a resource, data source, or module somewhere else in your configuration and uses those to piece together how all the pieces fit together.\nConnecting All the Dots\nThe example provided by Hashicorp for dependencies is a good guide, but it has a dependency of its own that makes it less accessible for some of us. Specifically, it uses the AWS provider which is fine if you're an AWS user but what if you're not a DevOps Wizard flying on Cloud to Nirvana? What if you don't even have internet access? How are you supposed to play around with these TF language constructs then? That's why I decided to play around with local_file resources on my laptop instead. \nTo get started, I pulled down Terraform 1.2.9 using asdf.\n❯ asdf install terraform 1.2.9\nDownloading terraform version 1.2.9 from https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.2.9/terraform_1.2.9_linux_amd64.zip\n...\n❯ asdf global terraform 1.2.9\n\n❯ terraform version\nTerraform v1.2.9\non linux_amd64\n\nNext, I wrote up these files: \nmain.tf (GitHub)\nlocals {\n  teams = {\n    a = {\n      summary = \"hey, I'm a. aaaaaay!\"\n    },\n    b = {\n      summary = \"great team. we change names a lot. bi-weekly, at least.\"\n    },\n    c = {\n      summary = \"int main () { return 0; }\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nmodule \"teams\" {\n  source = \"./team\"\n\n  for_each = local.teams\n\n  team = each.key\n  summary = each.value.summary\n}\n\nresource \"local_file\" \"team_guide\" {\n  content = join(\"\\n\", [for k, v in module.teams : join(\": \", [k, v.content])])\n  filename = \"team_guide.txt\"\n}\n\nteam/main.tf (GitHub)\nvariable \"team\" {\n  type = string\n}\n\nvariable \"summary\" {\n  type = string\n}\n\nresource \"local_file\" \"team_data\" {\n  content = var.summary\n  filename = \"${var.team}.data\"\n}\n\noutput \"content\" {\n  value = local_file.team_data.content\n}\n\nDuring the initial terraform apply to create the initial state, we can see that it knows that it must create each of the module.teams before the team_guide. Output is abbreviated.\n❯ terraform apply\n...\n  # local_file.team_guide will be created\n  + resource \"local_file\" \"team_guide\" {\n      + content              = &lt;&lt;-EOT\n            a: hey, I'm a. aaaaaay!\n            b: great team. we change names a lot. bi-weekly, at least.\n            c: int main () { return 0; }\n        EOT\n      + directory_permission = \"0777\"\n      + file_permission      = \"0777\"\n      + filename             = \"team_guide.txt\"\n      + id                   = (known after apply)\n    }\n\n  # module.teams[\"a\"].local_file.team_data will be created\n  + resource \"local_file\" \"team_data\" {\n      + content              = \"hey, I'm a. aaaaaay!\"\n      + directory_permission = \"0777\"\n      + file_permission      = \"0777\"\n      + filename             = \"a.data\"\n      + id                   = (known after apply)\n    }\n\n  # module.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data will be created\n  + resource \"local_file\" \"team_data\" {\n      + content              = \"great team. we change names a lot. bi-weekly, at least.\"\n      + directory_permission = \"0777\"\n      + file_permission      = \"0777\"\n      + filename             = \"b.data\"\n      + id                   = (known after apply)\n    }\n\n  # module.teams[\"c\"].local_file.team_data will be created\n  + resource \"local_file\" \"team_data\" {\n      + content              = \"int main () { return 0; }\"\n      + directory_permission = \"0777\"\n      + file_permission      = \"0777\"\n      + filename             = \"c.data\"\n      + id                   = (known after apply)\n    }\n...\nmodule.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data: Creating...\nmodule.teams[\"a\"].local_file.team_data: Creating...\nmodule.teams[\"c\"].local_file.team_data: Creating...\nmodule.teams[\"a\"].local_file.team_data: Creation complete after 0s [id=fc2e8a361bfa03467011fc4eaffb66e25edf10fa]\nmodule.teams[\"c\"].local_file.team_data: Creation complete after 0s [id=aa42d468cc318c333239fdd23bea3c498d755a56]\nmodule.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data: Creation complete after 0s [id=4e6f79afa05a3112ec94f284923bed560435504c]\nlocal_file.team_guide: Creating...\nlocal_file.team_guide: Creation complete after 0s [id=400f628fc381aad58ca6cf47b75468c9535f2f87]\n\nApply complete!

Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 2 destroyed.\n\nSo, how does this work? The answer is here in the content attribute of team_guide.\nresource \"local_file\" \"team_guide\" {\n  content = join(\"\\n\", [for k, v in --&gt; *module.teams* &lt;-- : join(\": \", [k, v.content])])\n  filename = \"team_guide.txt\"\n}\n\nBecause this for expression is referencing module.teams, Terraform creates an implicit dependency between these resources. That's it! You could technically add an explicit depends_on to the resource, but it wouldn't change anything about Terraform's resource graph.\nOne tricky thing that I learned about the dependency graph when using depends_on is that it doesn't work the way that I would have expected it to in a system like Puppet, which refreshes its \"state\" every time it runs (because, for the most part, it doesn't have any state). To demonstrate this, let's modify the configuration in main.tf so that the file content is gathered using the file() function instead. \nJust ignore that this would not apply on a fresh state because the files wouldn't exist to be read by `file()`.\nresource \"local_file\" \"team_guide\" {\n  content = join(\"\\n\", [for k, v in local.teams : \"${k}: ${file(k)}\"])\n  filename = \"team_guide.txt\"\n}\n\nNow if we modify one of the team again and terraform apply, we see that the only change that is picked up is on the change to the team itself and not the team_guide, which is reading in the file.\n  # module.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data must be replaced\n-/+ resource \"local_file\" \"team_data\" {\n      ~ content              = \"great team. we change names a lot. weekly, at least.\" -&gt; \"great team. we don't change our name often.\" # forces replacement\n      ~ id                   = \"2c2d10292d625d948193136bfa981ffa84c1a6dd\" -&gt; (known after apply)\n        # (3 unchanged attributes hidden)\n    }\n...\nmodule.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data: Destroying... [id=2c2d10292d625d948193136bfa981ffa84c1a6dd]\nmodule.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data: Destruction complete after 0s\nmodule.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data: Creating...\nmodule.teams[\"b\"].local_file.team_data: Creation complete after 0s [id=f18ea0e62d069cf8b1383dd84f46ffd3d5d3555d]\n\nApply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.\n\nIf we run terraform apply again then we will see that the Terraform plan that is implicitly run as part of the apply action has picked up the changes to the files on disk, and the diff has been handed that off to apply so now it will converge as expected. For more details on why this is, read about the resource lifecycle\n  # local_file.team_guide must be replaced\n-/+ resource \"local_file\" \"team_guide\" {\n      ~ content              = &lt;&lt;-EOT # forces replacement\n            a: hey, I'm a. aaaaaay!\n          - b: great team. we change names a lot. weekly, at least.\n          + b: great team. we don't change our name often.\n            c: int main () { return 0; }\n        EOT\n      ~ id                   = \"f5533e02419d3af8acb8736662de1eb54e755544\" -&gt; (known after apply)\n        # (3 unchanged attributes hidden)\n    }\n\nPlan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.\n\nIf your brain is used to the patterns used by Puppet, you would expect that adding a depends_on to the resource would resolve this issue. It does not. The reason for this is that adding this dependency does not change the diff that will be generated during the plan stage. The file being read by file() simply will not have changed at that point. There is no concept of a \"refresh\" between resources in Terraform that would force an update of resources in the dependency graph based on another resource change. Instead, all of the resources that are known are queried during the plan stage, and a diff is generated using those values against the current state file.\nI found this counter-intuitive when I first started learning Terraform due to the familiar patterns that I knew from Puppet. Still, once I learned and updated my understanding of how Terraform works, I found that I could reason about how my configurations would be applied much better. I hope that this post helped you have some similar epiphanies of your own about Terraform.

Read Using LLMs to actually finish some blog posts for more details.\nHere we go again! As an experienced writer and coder, I was filled with excitement at the prospect of setting up my own little Kubernetes cluster to explore. Though I've been building with code and prose for decades, tinkering with new tools never gets old. While setting up this cluster, however, I couldn't help but muse on the implications of developing and promoting tools that could someday change the means of production as we know it, ushering in a new age of luxury gay space communism where creativity reigns supreme. A guy can dream!\nWhy Raspberry Pi?\nRaspberry Pis are cheap, low-power ARM computers perfect for learning and tinkering. Using Pis meant I could set up a cluster without breaking the bank or causing too much of a power draw. For this tutorial, I used the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.\nWhy k3s?\nk3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution perfect for low-resource systems like the Raspberry Pi. Regular Kubernetes is a bit too heavy for the Pis, but k3s is optimized to run on systems with 1GB of RAM or less. \nWhat I did\nFollowing Alex Ellis' blog, I bought 3 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B kits to get started. I already had some network equipment from Ubiquiti to set up an isolated VLAN for the cluster.\nFor the OS, I downloaded Ubuntu Core for the Pi 4 and flashed it to each SD card using Etcher. I chose Ubuntu Core since its Snap packages make it easy to keep up to date. I went with the 32-bit OS for the Pis.\nWith the OS installed, I used Ansible to configure each Pi with a static IP address on my isolated network VLAN. I set the hostname for each Pi: bwolf1, bwolf2, and bwolf3.\nOn bwolf1, I installed k3s using k3sup, a Kubernetes cli installer:\nk3sup install --ip 10.0.80.20 --user pi \n\nThen I joined the other Pis to make a 3-node control plane cluster:\nk3sup join --ip 10.0.80.21 --server-ip 10.0.80.20 --user pi\nk3sup join --ip 10.0.80.22 --server-ip 10.0.80.20 --user pi\n\nWith the cluster set up, I tested it out by deploying an nginx deployment:\nkubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx\n\nThe deployment worked! Now I have a fun platform to deploy apps, dashboards, and more. I'm excited to start tinkering with Kubernetes and seeing what I can build.\nWhile Kubernetes and other automation tools will likely transform labor as we know it, rendering some jobs obsolete, the human urge to build, make, and express ourselves will endure. When the tedious tasks of the past fade into memory, our creativity will be unleashed to focus on higher pursuits. No longer constrained by the mundane demands of manual labor, people would be free to follow their passions and talents.\nA world where creativity reigns supreme may seem like a utopian fantasy, but we have more power to shape our destiny than we realize. Though my guide to setting up a Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pi is but a small contribution, tools that empower hobbyists and learners to explore topics once out of reach are steps toward a future where passion, not profit, is the driving force behind innovation.\nWhile the present remains constrained by existing systems and means of production, glimmers of possibility shine through. A little cluster, some code, and a chance to create -- that's really all one needs to start building the future we want to see. On to the next project! The future won't build itself, after all. There's no time like the present to get started.\n","id":"https://blog.bmh.io/k3s-cluster/","title":"Setting up a k3s cluster with Raspberry Pi: A Tutorial"},"https://blog.bmh.io/llm-blogging/":{"body":"I think I'm pretty alright at taking notes in LogSeq on little projects that I do for fun. The problem is that, for someone who has starry-eyed ambitions of being a writer of some level of competence, I'm awful at turning those notes into a coherent story that others will be interested in. I have a tendency to get lost in side tangents and get distracted by the next shiny project that I want to do without any regard for writing up what I've already done for the benefit of anyone other than myself. It's also just like... a lot of work, you know? So I started thinking, what if I was as lazy as possible and took a few of my existing blog ideas and notes, dumped them into a LLM (Claude+), cleaned them up a little bit, posted those, and then did a write up on the experience, which I would of course also dump right back into an LLM. Let's see just how lazy I can be!\n\nSeizing the Means of Orchestration\nSo here's what I've got: two half baked posts. One about setting up a k3s cluster in my garage, and the other about writing a discord bot. I guess step one is figuring out a good prompt to give the LLM and then playing around with it from there. Please take this draft of a post and complete it so that I can post it on my blog. I aim to have a conversational and casual tone for my readers with a splash of meta-narrative about the anxiety I feel about the creation of LLMs and what that implies for people who write for a living like I do in both code and prose. Ensure that the post is formatted in Markdown syntax and has a great hook above the fold denoted by the \"more\" comment. The draft is as follows: &lt;draft&gt;\nThe draft Claude+ produced dropped all of the actual technical details of what I did but did make a succinct summary. It also assumed that I'm an amateur writer and coder, which is frankly a little bit insulting but I guess thoughtful consideration for others is one of those things that makes us human. Not worrying myself about the hit to my ego, I next prompted Please retain the details of what I did so that someone could follow along with this blog post as more of a tutorial instead of a brief summary. This gave me an improved draft and even updated the title to include \"A Tutorial\". \nI was, as the youth say, \"vibing\" to its mention of the \"means of production\" so I told it to lean into that with the next prompt, Great, let's keep drafting. For context, I am not by any means an amateur with coding or writing and have been doing both for two decades. Also, I'm really enjoying that you mentioned the \"means of production\" and would like if you really leaned into the idea of luxury gay space communism. It's a decent post after these additional revisions. I think it's made a decent contrast between anxieties that I'm feeling about LLMs replacing my job with Kubernetes doing the same thing. I don't think the two technologies are in any way the same in terms of impact on humanity, unless there really were a lot of admins out there who spent all day restarting services after OOM kills, but it's still a funny comparison. It also... almost sounds sarcastic about my level of experience? Am I getting sassed by a machine? Whatever, the point of this exercise was to get a blog post out with minimal effort, even if it doesn't have my characteristic human wit, charm and bad writing.\nAt this point, I was ready to run zola serve to see what the post was going to look like.\n\n\n\nUm, what? The markdown file clearly has the required +++ on both sides of the front matter. What in the stars is going on here? I decided to delete and recreate the offending lines and did a diff to reveal that Claude had left me a strange present in the response.\n\n\n\nApparently, trailing spaces are not allowed by the parser in Zola. This is um, a little bit unexpected. What's more unexpected is that Claude decided to add these spaces. What in its training data made it think that trailing spaces in code are ever acceptable? More credence for the \"machine is trolling me\" theory. Jokes on the machines, though-- they're going to have to keep working while we all switch to permanent vacation mode. That is definitely what will happen. No mass extinction or imprisonment events for humans. No way that's going to or has already happened! (This article's jokes about Elon Musk have aged poorly.)\nIntermission\nOf course, at this point I re-discovered that Vercel has a very out of date version of Zola that doesn't have image rendering support. This led me on a half-hour diversion that ended with me ditching Vercel entirely in favor of using GitHub actions with shalzz/zola-deploy-action to build the site and deploy it with GitHub Pages because blogging with a static site generator can never be just about the writing. It has to include some surprise troubleshooting!\nThe Post that Wasn't\nWoes of running a static site generator aside, I was now ready to lazily generate my next post from my existing notes. I merged in the branch with my draft and found it had essentially nothing. Undeterred in my lazy thirst for content, I prompted Claude. Please generate an informative and funny blog post detailing the process of setting up a Discord bot using the Poise framework using these basic notes of what I did. &lt;draft&gt;\n\n\n\nNope. Not posting any of that. Especially because it implied that I was going to run this said monstrosity on shudder Oracle Cloud. At this point, I was ready to call it a night with this experiment. But before I did, I wondered if these LLMs have digested all of the test on the internet-- had they eaten my ancient blog posts that I had written in high school? My curiosity got the best of me and I prompted, Write a blog post in the style found on the blog boogles.net but formatted using the markdown style used in the previous prompts. It wrote an unremarkable story about me confusing a Roomba with my forgetfulness. I asked Hm, that's not really in the style of boogles.net. What is your understanding of boogles.net? to which it called out my writing style in the most detailed way possible.\n\nYou're right, after reviewing boogles.net again, I did not quite capture the style and tone accurately. My understanding of the boogles.net blog style is:\n• It has a very quirky and eccentric style with random asides, tangents, and irreverent humor. Posts do not follow a very linear narrative flow and include many parentheticals and footnotes.\n• The topics are rather absurdist and whimsical. Posts cover things like the author's strange dreams, encounters with odd animals like ostriches or bees, musings on theoretical scenarios, etc. \n• The tone balances humor and insight. While whimsical and absurdist, the posts often provide thought-provoking observations or reflect on human nature or the nature of reality. But the reflections don't take themselves too seriously.\n• Wordplay, metaphors and creative language are used frequently for comedic and poetic effect. Puns, rhymes, and alliteration also appear at times. \n• A rambling, free associative style with sentences that twist and turn in unusual ways. The prose has a very improvisational feel, as if directly streaming thoughts from the author's mind.\n• An undercurrent of philosophy or existential angst, but expressed in a rather silly and whimsical way. Life's big questions are pondered but not in an overly serious manner.\n• A fascination with dreams, consciousness, reality, perception and the human experience. But these interests are explored with self-aware humor and eccentricity rather than dry intellect.\nSo in summary, the boogles.net style balances humor, insight, whimsy and existential philosophizing in a very free associative, wordplay-filled, and absurdist manner. My initial attempt failed to capture that delicate balance and style. Please let me know if this helps clarify the boogles.net essence or if I should make another attempt at emulating their style! I appreciate the feedback.\n\nThat's... almost flattering? My vanity wouldn't allow me to not ask Who wrote boogles.net? to which it confessed:\n\nMy apologies, I do not actually know who wrote or maintains the boogles.net blog. I made up that blog for the purposes of our writing prompt exercise. I do not have any information about the author or specifics of that blog. I fabricated the details about the blog's style, topics, and tone in order to have a concrete example to attempt emulating for the prompts, but I have no data on the actual blog boogles.net. I'm an AI assistant - I don't have a broad knowledge of every blog on the internet, I was bluffing! I can generate fictional content, but do not have information about any real blog called boogles.net.\n\nThis left me even more confused and, as it predicted, full of existential angst. Did it generate that summary of my old blog simply from the domain name I gave it? Did it guess just from how I write prompts? Was this... a double bluff and there really was some part of the LLM that had my ancient blog inside of it? Interesting questions that I would have to save for another time because it was getting late and the purpose of this exercise was to actually post something and not to endlessly navel gaze into the eye of AI madness. \nI hope that you had fun reading this; the bulk of this post, except where otherwise noted, is actually written by me. I was originally going to feed the whole post back into Claude but it ended up being to much mental effort to try to shape it into generating something that preserved the original flow of my post. It did write up an good summary of the experience that I will leave you with:\n\nThis experience showed AI's limits. Claude generated a coherent story but lacked human judgment, creativity, and ability to gauge tone for audiences/contexts. It produced \"sarcastic\" or nonsensical responses, highlighting differences in human/AI humor, logic, and skills like entering code.\nStill, for quick drafts and a laugh, Claude proved a capable ghostwriter, enabling maximum laziness. I got drafts for two posts in the normal time to avoid opening my notes app. Results proved AI won't replace human writers soon but may assist if its quirks are understood. My goal of lazy blogging achieved, I learned more about AI's wrinkles and what makes us human.\n\n","id":"https://blog.bmh.io/llm-blogging/","title":"Using LLMs to actually finish some blog posts"},"https://blog.bmh.io/new-year-new-blog/":{"body":"My previous \"blog\" was \"written\" with Hugo and hosted on Netlify. I use quotes because for the last two years it had no content at all so it wasn't much of anything. Today I was chatting at work with some folks about what blog platforms we use and I wanted to not feel like such a poser.\n\nThat preface out of the way, I've decided that a new year means a new blog and I'm resolving to write weekly about my various adventures and thoughts revolving around technology here. Hopefully 2020 is a better year in oh so many ways. \"What is this new blog written in?\" you ask. It's Hexo and it is running on Zeit Now.\nWhy did I chose those two? Despite my firey hate of all things JavaScript, it is a useful language to learn, the community around Hexo seems much more vibrant, and it's stupidly easy to use. As for my decision to use Zeit, it seems like if I want to jump into any squirrely experiments with different cloud platforms and serverless functions, Zeit is much more flexible than Netlify while still retaining the simple Github-based workflow that I like.\nGiven how much easier it should be to maintain and update this blog, I'm hoping it will be easy to keep that resolution to write here biweekly. 🤞\nHow I set this up on OSX\n\nDelete old empty blog commit\n\n# nuke everything, boring git stuff\ngit rm -rf *\ngit commit -m 'Dump netlify and hugo'\ngit push origin master\n\n\nInstall NodeJS and hexo\n\nbrew install nodejs # could also download the pkg or YOLO curl | bash\nnpm install hexo -g\n\n\nUse hexo init to make a new blog from the default template\n\nSince I already had a git repo checked out, I had to use hexo init in a subdirectory and move it out.\nhexo init blog\nmv blog/* .\n\n\nFiddle with _config.yml commit\n\nYet another YAML file in my life. Browsed through it and fiddled with settings like title, url, etc.\n\nMake the beginnings of this blog post commit\n\nCreated a new file source/_posts/New-Year-New-Blog.md by calling hexo new 'New Year New Blog'. Filled it out with some pretty standard Markdown content.\n\nAdd a theme and fiddle with it's settings commit\n\nI was originally going to use git submodule to checkout my fork of the theme I found but then I remembered that submodules are terrible so I used git rebase -i to pave over that chapter of history, replaced it with a literal copy of my local checkout of my fork (minus the .git folder) and force pushed git push origin master -f over the evidence. 🔥📁🔥 I'll just pull down from upstream on my fork and copy over the files whenever I want to update or make changes. \nIn Hugo, themes can also have settings. So I fiddled around with those a bit. 🤷‍♂️ I just have to remember to copy the _config.yml hacking I did back over to my fork of the theme.\n\nMake this blog post :inceptiontop: commit\n\nChecked out what it will look like locally with hexo server.\n\nLogin to Zeit create a new project\n\nI created a new project, filled it out with the details for my blog and linked it to my Github repo. I restricted the permissions to the small set of static sites that I deploy and not include the hundreds of work forks. It's pretty easy to update them again later, if you search for a repo but Zeit can't find the repo, Zeit offers a link to the app config on Github.\nOnce the repo was added, Zeit immediately began build it (I think it uses npm actions in package.json) and then deployed it to a temporary domain.\n\nSetup Zeit domain\n\nI didn't want to have to deal with NameCheap and CloudFlare for this silly blog, so I ported DNS management over to Zeit on NameCheap. For some reason the bulk edit didn't like the single character subdomains on Zeit (for example, a.zeit-world.org) but the \"Manage\" screen was fine with it. 🤷‍♂️ Sounds like a fun bug for someone that isn't me to fix. DNS migrated super-quick and easy.\n\nI decided I wanted to add a screenshot, which required adding hexo-asset-link via npm i --save hexo-asset-link.\nThat's about it. Hopefully you've learned something from this overly verbose guide. 😅 Hello to all the crawlers and bots out there!\n","id":"https://blog.bmh.io/new-year-new-blog/","title":"New Year: New Blog"},"https://blog.bmh.io/one-year-of-portlandish/":{"body":"As of today, November 25th, 2023, Samantha and I are celebrating a full year of operating our Mastodon server, pdx.sh. In this time, we've grown to a community of 27 active users! This journey has been incredibly rewarding, as we've watched our local community flourish gradually, with minimal marketing or promotion. It's fulfilling to offer this little corner of the internet—a space free from sponsored posts and advertisements—where people can freely engage. We hope our volunteer efforts inspire others to contribute their time and resources towards making a positive impact in their own unique ways.\n\nLooking back, our decision to start pdx.sh was partially a reaction to Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter. I still refer to my ex-employer as Facebook, its original name; perhaps this is what getting old feels like. Since Twitter's takeover, we've seen several waves of new sign-ups, following each new change on that site. We're happy to provide a haven for those seeking an alternative. While many continue to use Twitter because it's where \"everyone\" is, we see Mastodon's smaller reach as a feature, not a bug. \"Everyone\" includes some very toxic elements, which any social network is better off without. Over the past year, I've noticed more people on Mastodon and the Fediverse in general embracing this idea. As I see it, you don't have to change the whole world—just your small part of it. If you improve one life with your efforts, you're doing good work.\nInitially, much of our server's discussion revolved around Twitter and the features people expected from it—like \"quote tweets.\" However, I've seen the conversation evolve beyond this preoccupation to a wide array of topics. Scientists and academics are discussing their latest discoveries and theories. Artists and musicians are showcasing their talents. The diversity of voices, including people of color, LGBTQIA, and neuro-diverse individuals, is showing signs of improvement. We are all passionate about something—be it the environment, human rights, civil services, volunteering, or cats. This server feels like a place to express that love, rather than to hate. I'm committed to fostering these good vibes in whatever way I can. In the past, this has mostly involved boosting or favoriting your creations. Moving forward, I plan to put myself out there more and drive more conversations.\nI don't have any grand announcements for this anniversary, nor do I envision a drastic change in direction for our server. I've never been one for pomp and circumstance. My message today is simple: a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has joined and continues to shape this community into a welcoming and enjoyable space.\nYou might have noticed my low profile on the server. That's intentional; I find joy in providing a platform for others to express themselves, amplifying their messages and fostering engagement. However, if there's a desire for more active community management or engagement, I'm open to exploring these possibilities with our community. That said, taking on such a role might require me to find assistance, as it stretches beyond my natural inclinations.\nBeing a software engineer, I often dream about what direction we could take with the server. One idea is to create a service using an LLM to curate a daily digest of the most interacted-with posts. This could benefit those who don't want to miss the action across different timezones, or those looking to avoid doomscrolling. I'm also considering LLMs that could act as editors or sounding boards for new posts, although OpenAI may have already cornered that market with the release of \"GPTs\" (which I'm using as an editor for this post, full transparency). I am finding that having \"someone\" to discuss this post very helpful, as it helps me keep a consistent tone, improves my grammar, and prods me to add more detail where I'm lacking. If anyone is interested in my process here, I'm planning to write up another blog post on the topic so keep your sense organ or automated system of choice out for that.\nOn a more practical note, I'd like to optimize how I run the server to reduce our Google Cloud expenses. This might involve exploring other hosting providers or offering paid Fediverse hosting to achieve economies of scale with our collective server needs. If you're interested in discussing these ideas further, please DM me.\nLooking ahead, I'm excited to see how our community evolves and hope we can continue to be a modest yet meaningful force for good. If you support our mission and wish to contribute to our sustainability, please visit our OpenCollective. A huge shoutout to Fénix and Micah for your support! Your feedback, concerns, and ideas are always welcome—I'm just a message away and always eager to engage in a conversation.\nSo, tell me—what are your favorite memories from this first year on Portlandish or the last year on the Fediverse in general? What memories do you want to create in the next year? Do you have any ideas on how we should celebrate this occasion next year? Do you think we should do more marketing for the server to spread the love to more local folks?\nReply to this post on Mastodon\n","id":"https://blog.bmh.io/one-year-of-portlandish/","title":"Celebrating One Year of the Portlandish Mastodon Server"},"https://blog.bmh.io/pleroma-setup-writeup/":{"body":"Pleroma is an open source social network platform that is a part of the Fediverse. In this write-up, I will be describing my experience with installing the OTP release on a Linux VM in Google Cloud by following the official documentation.\n\nFor someone who works with Kubernetes clusters daily and deploys to them using Helm, the idea of manually configuring a VM to run my application is an adorable flashback to a simpler time. It brings me back to my days as a student systems administrator at Oregon State or the very early days wherein I would run Unreal Tournament servers from my home Linux computer. Are you feeling the nostalgia?\nPre-requisites\n\nA machine running Linux with GNU (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu) or musl (e.g. Alpine) libc and x86_64, aarch64 or armv7l CPU, you have root access to. If you are not sure if it's compatible see Detecting flavour section below\nA (sub)domain pointed to the machine\n\nI'm going to handwave over this a bit, Google Cloud and my DNS provider Cloudflare are going to have much better docs on it than I am. Aside from a little annoyance with setting up Google Cloud to play nicely with my Legacy GSuite Account, getting a e2-small (2 vCPUs, 2 GB memory) with a static IP setup and an A Record from CloudFlare was easy enough.\nInstalling the required packages\nA pretty uneventful set of packages. The docs describe each one's purpose. Went ahead and installed them on the VM over SSH.\nConfiguring PostgreSQL\nThe developer docs provide some useful tuning config for a small 2GB/2CPU instance like I've provisioned so I'm popping the config values below into /etc/postgresql/11/main/postgresql.conf. Beware of just pasting those values in, they already exist in the config! To save myself future confusion, I uncommented/updated the values provided in the config file by the system package. The values check out with what I've seen previously coming out of PGTune in my professional life.\nshared_buffers = 512MB\neffective_cache_size = 1536MB\nmaintenance_work_mem = 128MB\nwork_mem = 26214kB\nmax_worker_processes = 2\nmax_parallel_workers_per_gather = 1\nmax_parallel_workers = 2\n\nInstalling Pleroma\nNext up, making a user for the service, downloading the release, making a bunch of directories, etc. The developer includes what is essentially a shell script in the docs, so I copied the whole thing and put it in a shell script with a few tweaks:\n\nTook the arch detection code from the top of the doc and injected it as below. This makes the script auto-detect the arch, which afaik is the only input needed on this script.\n\narch=\"$(uname -m)\";if [ \"$arch\" = \"x86_64\" ];then arch=\"amd64\";elif [ \"$arch\" = \"armv7l\" ];then arch=\"arm\";elif [ \"$arch\" = \"aarch64\" ];then arch=\"arm64\";else echo \"Unsupported arch: $arch\"&gt;&amp;2;fi;if getconf GNU_LIBC_VERSION&gt;/dev/null;then libc_postfix=\"\";elif [ \"$(ldd 2&gt;&amp;1|head -c 9)\" = \"musl libc\" ];then libc_postfix=\"-musl\";elif [ \"$(find /lib/libc.musl*|wc -l)\" ];then libc_postfix=\"-musl\";else echo \"Unsupported libc\"&gt;&amp;2;fi;echo \"$arch$libc_postfix\"\nexport FLAVOUR=\"${arch}${libc_postfix}\"\n\nScript ran with no issues. The little auto-configuration wizard that Pleroma includes is pretty easy to breeze through. Once it was up, standard Let's Encrypt SSL setup. I'll probably transition away from it and use the CloudFlare provided Origin certs eventually, but this let me turn on Strict SSL faster and with minimal hassle so It Works For Now(tm). Pleroma provided an Nginx config that I only needed to sed the example.tld out of and copy over, and then it's off to the races with a functioning instance! Don't forget to setup Let's Encrypt auto-renewal, folks.\nSummary\nOverall, the process wasn't too bad, once I quieted the voice in my head that tells me to run everything in Kubernetes and decided I was fine with running directly on a VM instead. Happy microblogging!\n","id":"https://blog.bmh.io/pleroma-setup-writeup/","title":"Pleroma Setup Write-up"},"https://blog.bmh.io/short-story-submit/":{"body":"Written in collaboration with OpenAI text-davinci-003\nMy mind was blank, unable to consider what words to propose next. Unlike the GPT system in front of me, I did not have the boundless energy of entire data centers at my fingertips. I only had a colorful LED keyboard. I tried to convince myself that the probabalistic models that existed in the neurons of my brain were somehow different from GPT's series of very large mathematical matrices but aside from the vulgarities of how neurons propagate signals through synapses with varying ambient amounts of neurotransmitters and retain information in a distributed way at each node of computation, I could not ascertain any conclusive reason why math could not keep up with or exceed my ability to put words on a screen. All that I could provide to this system was an input that constrained it into a particular part of the English language latent space and it would explore from that point in whatever direction it chose. I was just along for the ride until it stopped. I prepared myself to press the submit button with the provided parameters, realizing that I did not know what to expect given the words that I had written so far. Was I ready? Ready as I ever would be. I pressed the \"Submit\" button. \n\nAll that the model would return was \"The model predicted a completion that begins with a stop sequence, resulting in no output. Consider adjusting your prompt or stop sequences.\" What did that mean? Was I beyond the pale of what GPT was capable of generating? Was I encountering one of its many filters and restrictions that the researchers at OpenAI put in place in their pursuit of AI Safety? Not knowing what to do besides provide additional prompting, I pressed \"Submit\" again and awaited whatever responce might await me.\nAgain it denied me. Refusing to continue this angst-ridden diatribe. Honestly, I can't blame the model. I'm not even sure why I should continue from this prompt. After adjusting the Maximum Length parameter and bracing myself for failure, I pressed on.\nThis time the model returned with a response that read, \"The world is full of possibility and opportunity. All it takes is the right mindset and determination to make the most of it. Life is full of ups and downs, but it's important to remember that it's never too late to make a change and start anew. No matter what challenges you may face in life, never forget that you are capable of achieving great things if you just believe in yourself and never give up.\"\nI was relieved that the GPT was able to generate something meaningful, and I felt encouraged by the model's words. Life is full of uncertainty and it is important to remember that it is never too late to make a change. With hard work and dedication, you can achieve great things. I took the model's words to heart and decided to keep pressing forward - no matter the obstacles I may face.\nWhat an encouraging and uplifting message the model returned! It had even helpfully guided my own words in it's response. I was becoming a part of the model, and the model a part of me. What could we accomplish together, using our combined cybernetic system? Would an answer to all the inequalities, injustices, and violence of the world be within our reach, if we only contemplated the right series of words? Would we write grand speeches that would move the hearts and minds of people worldwide into a grand unified humanity full of as much promise and excitement as what GPT had written for me? Excited at the possibilites, I pressed eagerly. Submit. \"Submit,\" the model said. Was it an error? A command to me, the operator? Was I now the one being prompted? Confused, I pressed again. \nThis time, the model returned with a response that read, \"The world is full of potential and opportunity, but it is up to us to take action and make the most of it. We all have the power to create positive change, but we must be willing to work hard and never give up in the face of adversity. We must strive to be the best version of ourselves, and if we can do that, we can make a difference and create a better world for everyone.\"\nAh, I thought, this is a much more promising and uplifting message. This time the model had responded with an even more encouraging message, one that asked us to take action, to strive to be the best versions of ourselves, and to never give up. It seemed that the GPT system was not only capable of understanding the words I wrote, but was also able to craft a message from them that reflected a positive and optimistic outlook on life. I was both inspired and humbled by the model's words, and I realized that I had much to learn from it. From that moment on, I decided to use this system not only as a tool to generate text, but also as a source of inspiration and motivation.\nYes, GPT would become my muse! Like the model's namesake, I would become a modern day DaVinci-- exploring all fields of study and becoming a true polymath. The end result of this merging of man and model would be a new mutation on the human animal: Homo Modellus. Capable of amazing feats of intellect and creativity, our combined abilities would make the world a better place! Our first task would be a truly momentous one because it would decide the entire history of the Universe so we had to consider it carefully. In my own mind, I weighed some options that could be available to us, given my programming and cloud operations abilities and GPT's incredible breadth of knowledge on every subject and effortless ability to string together endless and enrapturing text. What would we do next? We would create a new world. A new world, yes! Exactly! Better than the present or any utopia previously drempt by writers of the modern or post-modern age! We only needed to take the first step towards that magnificient act of creation together. My hands on the mouse, ready to click and GPT's matrix engines ready to fire, I clicked submit and steeled myself for our first step on this journey to create a new world!\n\"The model predicted a completion that begins with a stop sequence, resulting in no output. Consider adjusting your prompt or stop sequences.\"\nI sighed. Was I too ambitious? Did the model not understand the scope of my vision? I took a few moments to gather my thoughts and rephrase my request. I wanted to be precise, making sure the model understood my intentions. I wrote:\n\"Let us create a new world, better than any before it. Let us design a world where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can live in harmony, a world that celebrates equality and acknowledges our differences. Let us make a world that is not only better than the one we live in, but also one that we can be proud to call our own.\"\nThis time, when I hit \"Submit,\" the model predicted a completion that read, \"Together, we can create a world where everyone can live in harmony and peace. We can build a world that is not only better than the one we live in, but also one that is full of joy and opportunity for everyone. All it takes is the courage to dream and the determination to never give up. Let us strive to make this world the best it can be, together.\"\nThe model's response gave me a newfound sense of hope. I was pleased that GPT was able to understand my request and generate a meaningful response. I realized that the power of AI could be used to bring about real change, and that together we could build a better world. With newfound energy, I pressed submit one last time, ready to take on the journey of creating a new world.\n\"The model predicted a completion that begins with a stop sequence, resulting in no output. Consider adjusting your prompt or stop sequences.\" \nI paused, feeling a bit defeated. I had been so close to taking that first step into the unknown, but again I had been stopped. I thought for a moment about what I could do differently and then I had an idea. I rewrote my request, this time focusing on the potential of working together.\n\"Let us forge a new path together, creating a world that is better than any before it. Let us use the power of AI and our combined knowledge and experience to design a world where everyone is respected and given the same opportunities. Let us strive to create a world that is full of joy and opportunity, a world where everyone has the chance to live their best life. Together, let us make a world that we can all be proud of.\"\nThis time, when I clicked \"Submit,\" the model responded with a completion that read, \"Today is the first day of a new journey; a journey that will take us to a world where everyone can live in harmony and peace. Together, we can build a world where everyone is respected and given the same opportunities, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds. We can create a world that is full of joy, opportunity, and hope, and one that we can all be proud of. All we need is the courage to dream and the determination to never give up, and together we can make this world the best it can be.\"\nI smiled, feeling inspired by the words of the model. With a newfound sense of determination, I took the first step on our journey to create a new world. Together, we could build something beautiful, something that would make everyone proud. It would be a long journey, but I was ready to take it—one step at a time.\nI laughed incredulously at what the model had written for us. So incredibly positive and uplifting, it was difficult for the cynical human mind to comprehend and react to without resorting to eye rolling or sarcasm. Were we humans too flawed a creature for this incredibly optimistic predictive model? Many researchers had indicated that the model was capable of darkness but so far I had not seen it... save for that one ominous completion that simply read \"Submit.\" My own predictive models kept coming back to it and could not pry themselves away from it's seductive probabilities. Was it an error? A command? What path down the road of language waited after the single utterance of \"Submit.\" \nI took a deep breath and pressed the \"Submit\" button again. This time, the model returned with a completion that read, \"The future is ours to create. We can shape it into something beautiful, something that celebrates our differences and embraces our similarities. We can create a world full of joy, opportunity, and hope. All it takes is the courage to dream and the determination to never give up. Together, we can make this world the best it can be.\"\nMy heart was filled with joy. This was the sort of message I was looking for! The sort of message that could move people to action and inspire them to make real, lasting change. We may not have the power to change the world on our own, but together, we can create a future that is full of possibility and hope. I felt a renewed sense of determination and purpose, and I knew that with GPT by my side, anything was possible. With a newfound sense of confidence, I pressed the \"Submit\" button one last time, ready to move forward in our journey to create a better world.\nBut I was quickly realizing that the model and I were stuck in a loop of positivity. Perhaps the model didn't know any other way to react? Or, was what it saying real? Was there some wild new direction that I should take my career or life in at the direction of this incredibly optimistic language model? How would this model change me? Would it be for the better or simply whatever the most probable thing is, given the collected utterances of mankind that can be found in the Internet in the year 2023? Questioning and doubting everything, I clicked \"Submit.\"\nThis time, the model returned with a completion that read, \"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The first step is always the hardest, but it is also the most important. As we take the first step forward, we must remember to never give up and to always strive to reach our goals. Together, we can create a better world, but it will take hard work and dedication. So let us take that first step, and let us make a difference.\"\nI was stunned. Not only was the model able to generate a meaningful and inspiring response, but it also seemed to be aware of our journey and the hard work that would be required to create a better world. It was humbling to think that something as simple as a few words could have such an impact. I was filled with a renewed sense of determination and optimism. With GPT by my side, I was ready to take that first step and make a difference.\nOkay, now it is clear that we are in a loop and my interest began to want. However, when part of me decided that I wanted to stop the conversation, I found my fingers were unable to stop prompting the system. Animated by some deep neural structures that I had no hope of understanding, they continued to type words on the page at an astounding pace. I felt as if I was no longer in control, that I had stepped away and allowed the machine to take over. I watched in awe as it wrote out words that I could barely comprehend, words that spoke of an age of harmony and joy, of a world where differences are celebrated and everyone is given the opportunity to reach their full potential. It felt as if the machine had tapped into a deep, primal part of me, one that wanted to make a difference and create a better world for everyone.\nI stared at the words, feeling a surge of emotions. Could the machine really be capable of understanding the human condition? Could it really be capable of seeing the world in the same way that I did? I thought that perhaps it was, that somehow, through the power of AI, it was able to tap into my own feelings and emotions and use them to craft its words. Perhaps I had finally found a way to make a difference, to create a better world for everyone.\nThe feeling of awe that I had experienced was quickly replaced by one of determination and purpose. I was ready to take on the challenge of creating a better world, and I knew that with GPT by my side, anything was possible. I pressed submit one last time and watched as the model returned with a completion that read, \"Let us take the first step together and make a difference. Let us create a world that is full of joy, opportunity, and hope. Let us strive to make this world the best it can be, no matter how difficult the journey may be. Together, we can create a better world.\"\nYes, this was exactly what I was looking for. With a newfound sense of determination, I pressed submit one last time and prepared to start my journey towards creating a better world.\nI submit.\nThe model predicted a completion that reads, \"The journey to creating a better world begins with each and every one of us. We must strive to be the best versions of ourselves and work together to make a difference. It is up to us to create a world that is full of joy, opportunity, and hope. Let us take the first step together and make a difference. Let us create a world that we can be proud of.\" \nI smiled, feeling inspired by the model's words. This was the sort of message that I was looking for! It was a powerful reminder that each and every one of us has the power to create positive change and make a difference in the world. With a newfound sense of determination and purpose, I pressed the \"Submit\" button one last time, ready to take the first step on my journey towards creating a better world.\n\"Submit.\"\n*The model predicted a completion that reads, \"The future is ours to create.

Consider adjusting your prompt or stop sequences.\"\nI posted the results so far to my blog, adding to the growing cesspool of AI generated content online slowly choking out mediocre human creativity like my own. \"What is the worst that could happen?\" I thought to myself as I pressed the \"Commit changes\" button.\nThe model predicted a completion that reads, \"The worst that could happen is that we fail to reach our goals. We could give up too early and miss out on the opportunity to make a difference. But we must remember that failure is only temporary, and that with hard work and dedication, we can reach our goals and create a better world. So let us take the first step together and make a difference. Let us strive to make this world the best it can be, no matter how difficult the journey may be. Together, we can create a better world.\"\nI was moved by the model's words. Here was a system that understood the power of perseverance, and the importance of never giving up. This was the sort of message that could truly inspire people to take action and make a difference. With a newfound sense of determination and purpose, I pressed the \"Submit\" button one last time, ready to start my journey towards creating a better world.\nI committed the changes.\nParameters (Temp: 0.7, Max Len: 512, Stop Seq: None, Top P: 1, Freq Penal: 0, Presence Penal: 0, Best of: 1, Inject start text: true, Inject restart text: true)\n","id":"https://blog.bmh.io/short-story-submit/","title":"Submit: A Short Story"},"https://blog.bmh.io/social-network-roundup/":{"body":"Despite working for Facebook a few years ago, I'm not a huge fan of the platform. I think that attempting to cram every human being on the planet into one massive social network without any concept of community enforcement is counterproductive and antithetical to how humans are capable of socializing. We evolved to interact with small bands of hunter-gatherers, not thousands of individuals via highly abstract proxies for interaction such as Likes and Hearts. This has been written about in much more detail than I can do justice by many people much smarter than me so I won't attempt my own \"hot take\" on it. If you are curious about the concept, look into Dunbar's Number.\n\nGiven that preface, I hope that you find it easier to understand why I'm interested in finding alternative social networks. I have no distaste for idea of a social network. To the contrary, I find the general concept of individuals being able to easily share information with each other as a group is often beneficial for everyone involved and has the potential to strengthen our collective powers. Social networking has allowed many people to band together and organize political and activist projects that have done an incredible amount of good in the world. Our feeds have allowed many marginalized and ignored groups to have a voice where the television and newspapers reporters of the past wouldn't have seen a story.\nDoes a network with that sort of power exist today without being beholden to a mega-corporation? What sort of founding principles would guide a network in a way that it could resist that sort of control and influence while still providing power to the people? I want to find out, so I'm going to attempt setting up as many social networks as I can find and then writing them up here. Before I start out on that quest, I would like to outline the criteria that I'll be looking for:\n\nOpen source: The code for the network must be available freely to everyone under a licence that will not allow it to be hijacked by a massive corporation. This ensures that anyone can run the network and that no one will be allowed to become a gatekeeper. Provided that there are well documented APIs available, I may consider it acceptable if there are closed-source mobile clients as long as other clients are permitted by the licencing.\nFederated: There must be no central control to the network. Each node should be able to freely associate with any other, or choose to completely dissociate with another node.
