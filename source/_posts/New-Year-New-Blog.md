My previous "blog" was "written" with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I use quotes because for the last two years it had no content at all so it wasn't much of anything. Today I was chatting at work with some folks about what blog platforms we use and I wanted to not feel like such a poser.

That preface out of the way, I've decided that a new year means a new blog and I'm resolving to write weekly about my various adventures and thoughts revolving around technology here. Hopefully 2020 is a better year in oh so many ways. "What is this new blog written in?" you ask. It's [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and it is running on [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/).

Why did I chose those two? Despite my firey hate of all things JavaScript, it is a useful language to learn, the community around [Hexo](https://hexo.io) seems much more vibrant, and it's stupidly easy to use. As for my decision to use Zeit, it seems like if I want to jump into any squirrely experiments with different cloud platforms and serverless functions, Zeit is much more flexible than Netlify while still retaining the simple Github-based workflow that I like.

Given how much easier it should be to maintain and update this blog, I'm hoping it will be easy to keep that resolution to write here biweekly. ðŸ¤ž
